We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours and provide an estimated timeline for addressing the issue.

## Security Features

### Encryption
- All sensitive data is encrypted using AES-GCM with a 256-bit key
- Keys are derived using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- Salt is randomly generated for each encryption operation
- Keys are stored securely in the OS keychain

### Authentication
- Password requirements:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Must contain uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Must contain numbers and special characters
  - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Session management:
  - 30-minute timeout
  - Maximum 10 concurrent sessions
  - Secure session storage

### API Security
- Rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- API key validation and format checking
- Request size limits
- Content-Type validation
- CORS configuration

### File System Security
- File permissions restricted to owner only
- Path traversal prevention
- File type validation
- Size limits on uploads
- Secure temporary file handling

### Network Security

- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Secure cookie settings

### Browser Security
- Sandboxed browser automation
- Secure browser arguments
- Resource limits
- Timeout handling
- Error recovery

## Security Best Practices

### Development
1. Use TypeScript for type safety
2. Follow secure coding guidelines
3. Regular security audits
4. Dependency vulnerability scanning
5. Code review process

### Deployment
1. Regular security updates
2. Automated testing
3. Environment-specific configurations
4. Secure build process
5. Release signing

### Monitoring
1. Security event logging
2. Error tracking
3. Performance monitoring
4. Access logging
5. Audit trails

## Security Configuration

### Content Security Policy
```javascript
{
  'default-src': ["'self'"],
  'script-src': ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
  'style-src': ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
  'img-src': ["'self'", 'data:', 'https:'],
  'connect-src': ["'self'", 'https:'],
  'font-src': ["'self'"],
  'object-src': ["'none'"],
  'media-src': ["'self'"],
  'frame-src': ["'none'"],
  'sandbox': ['allow-scripts', 'allow-same-origin']
}
```

### Rate Limiting
```javascript
{
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
}
```

### Session Configuration
```javascript
{
  timeout: 30 * 60 * 1000, // 30 minutes
  maxSessions: 10,
  cleanupInterval: 5 * 60 * 1000 // 5 minutes
}
```
